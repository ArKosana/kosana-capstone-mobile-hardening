DEMO SCRIPT - 3-5 MINUTES

[START RECORDING]

"Hi, I'm Kosana. This demo shows my automated mobile app security hardening pipeline."

[Terminal - Show clean workspace]
"First, let me show you the project structure with all our automation scripts."

ls -la scripts/

[Terminal]
"Now I run the static scan to find vulnerabilities in our banking app..."

./scripts/static_scan.sh

"The scan found critical exported components - banking activities that can be accessed without any authentication."

[Terminal]
"Let me demonstrate the exploit - component hijacking..."

./scripts/component_hijack_poc.sh

"As you can see, all banking screens open without login. This is a critical security vulnerability - attackers can bypass authentication completely."

[Terminal]
"Now I apply the automated security patch..."

./scripts/patch_and_rebuild.sh

"The patch successfully secures all vulnerable components using Python-based XML modification."

[Terminal]
"Let's verify the exploit is now blocked..."

./scripts/verify_patch.sh

"Perfect! All exploits now return 'Permission Denial' errors. The vulnerability is completely fixed."

"The pipeline successfully identified, demonstrated, and fixed a critical security vulnerability, producing complete evidence for auditors."

[STOP RECORDING]

RECORDING TIPS:
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Show terminal commands and outputs clearly
- Keep each demo segment under 1 minute
- Emphasize the before/after contrast
- Show the evidence files at the end
