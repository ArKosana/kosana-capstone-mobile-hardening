Speaker Note: "Hi, I'm Kosana. This project demonstrates building a fast, repeatable pipeline that finds app vulnerabilities, shows exploits, applies fixes, and proves remediation with complete evidence."

SLIDE 2 - ELEVATOR PITCH
A complete pipeline that finds mobile app vulnerabilities, demonstrates a proof-of-concept exploit, and applies automated hardening — producing auditor-ready evidence.

Speaker Note: "This isn't just about finding bugs - it's about building a reproducible process that delivers verifiable security improvements."

SLIDE 3 - PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Component hijacking via exported activities
• Data exposure through insecure backups
• Lack of automated security hardening
• Need for reproducible evidence in security assessments

Speaker Note: "Mobile apps often expose sensitive components without protection, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access critical functions directly."

SLIDE 4 - OBJECTIVES
1. Scan - Automated vulnerability detection
2. Exploit - Demonstrate real-world risk
3. Patch - Apply security hardening  
4. Verify - Confirm remediation
5. Report - Document complete evidence

Speaker Note: "We follow a systematic approach: find it, prove it, fix it, verify it, and document everything."

SLIDE 5 - TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
• apktool - APK decompilation/rebuilding
• jadx - Java source analysis
• adb - Android device communication
• Python - Automated security patching
• Git - Version control & documentation

Speaker Note: "Using open-source tools, we built an automated pipeline that's accessible and reproducible."

SLIDE 6 - CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND
• DoTransfer - Money transfer screen exposed
• ViewStatement - Account statements exposed
• PostLogin - Main banking interface exposed
• ChangePassword - Password change exposed
• TrackUserContentProvider - Data access exposed
• MyBroadCastReceiver - Broadcast receiver exposed
• allowBackup="true" - Data extraction possible

Speaker Note: "We found 6 exported components in a banking app - any could be accessed without login, plus insecure backups allowing data theft."

SLIDE 7 - EXPLOIT DEMONSTRATION
COMPONENT HIJACKING CONFIRMED:
- Banking activities accessible without authentication
- Money transfers, account data, password changes exposed
- Real-world impact: Unauthorized financial transactions

Speaker Note: "We proved the vulnerability by launching banking screens directly - no login required. This is component hijacking in action."

SLIDE 8 - AUTOMATED REMEDIATION
SECURITY HARDENING APPLIED:
- All exported components secured (exported="false")
- Backup protection enabled (allowBackup="false") 
- Python-based automated patching
- Complete verification testing

Speaker Note: "Our automated script patched all vulnerabilities. The same components now return 'Permission Denial' when accessed externally."

SLIDE 9 - EVIDENCE & VERIFICATION
PRODUCED:
- Before/after static scan comparisons
- Executive summary with technical findings
- Automated patch scripts
- Installation verification logs
- Component hijacking proof
- Patch effectiveness testing

Speaker Note: "Every step is documented - from original vulnerabilities to verified fixes. This is auditor-ready evidence."

SLIDE 10 - RESULTS & IMPACT
BEFORE: Component hijacking possible, data exposure risk
AFTER: All components secured, exploits blocked
IMPACT: Production-ready security pipeline

FUTURE WORK:
- CI/CD integration
- Extended security checks
- MobSF integration

Speaker Note: "We transformed a vulnerable banking app into a secure one, with a reproducible process that can be integrated into development pipelines."

SLIDE 11 - REPRODUCTION & CONTACT
COMPLETE REPRODUCTION:
- GitHub repository with all code
- Step-by-step instructions
- All evidence and logs included
